## Sphero Simon
Sphero Simon is a game with three modes:

- Robot-Only allows the human to give a Sphero commands, which they must do in-order or lose.
- Human-Only has the Sphero give the player commands, which they must do in-order or lose.
- Human vs. Robot combines the previous two game modes, with player and robot issuing commands to each other until one loses.

## Spheropoly
Spheropoly is a game that's a little like Monopoly, but is played by a single player versus an AI. The AI uses the Sphero as its piece.
