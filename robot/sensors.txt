Keeping note of my sensor findings for the actual gameplay:

"Drop":
    Vertical acceleration nears 0 as the droid enters freefall. It remains relatively stable when spinning.

"Spin":
    Z-Axis Gyroscope Sensing skyrockets when the droid is spinning (over 1000). When dropped, Z-spin seems to go up, but never above 200.
    A good threshold for this would probably be >500 to detect spin alone.

"Light":
    The ambient light level of my room is around 25-30. When I shine my headlamp at the droid, it shoots up to well over 1000. To account
    for potential changes in illumination (since I won't be filming on the day that I code this), a good illumination threshold is probably
    >500.
